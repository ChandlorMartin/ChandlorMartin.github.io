        <p>My name is Chandlor Martin and I am a full-stack engineer.
          To me, programming is like solving a puzzle where your finished program is the answer.
          Finding that answer is a great joy to me and why I decided to become a software engineer.
          I already have a well-sized set of skills and I hope to continue to learn everything I can about software engineering as I further my career.
